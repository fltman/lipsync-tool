# Lipsync Tool Development Specification

## Executive Summary
A web-based application with local backend for processing video segments through the KlingAI lipsync API. Users can select portions of an uploaded video, process them for lip synchronization, review results, and export a final video with approved segments replaced.

## System Architecture

### Components
- **Frontend**: Web interface accessible via browser
- **Backend**: Local server (Python or Node.js) handling video processing
- **Processing Engine**: FFmpeg for video manipulation
- **External API**: KlingAI lipsync service
- **Storage**: Temporary local filesystem storage

### Architecture Benefits
- No file size limitations from browser constraints
- Direct FFmpeg access for efficient processing
- Better memory management for large videos
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Secure API key storage on backend

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Video Upload and Management

#### 1.1 Upload Functionality
- Accept common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM)
- No practical file size limit (handled by backend)
- Generate unique session ID for each upload
- Store original video in temporary directory
- Maintain session state throughout processing

#### 1.2 Video Display
- Stream video from backend to frontend player
- Provide standard playback controls
- Display video metadata (duration, resolution, framerate, codec)
- Show visual timeline with waveform (optional but recommended)

### 2. Segment Selection System

#### 2.1 Selection Interface
- Frame-accurate timeline navigation
- Mark-in/Mark-out functionality with visual indicators
- Time input fields supporting format: HH:MM:SS.mmm
- Visual preview of selected range on timeline
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient operation:
  - I: Mark in-point
  - O: Mark out-point
  - Space: Play/pause
  - Arrow keys: Frame stepping

#### 2.2 Selection Validation
- Minimum segment duration (e.g., 0.5 seconds)
- Maximum segment duration (based on API limitations)
- Prevent overlapping selections
- Warning for very long segments (processing time consideration)

### 3. Queue Management

#### 3.1 Queue Operations
- Add segments with timestamp and duration info
- Display queue with:
  - Segment number
  - Start/end timestamps
  - Duration
  - Current status
  - Thumbnail preview
- Remove individual segments
- Clear entire queue
- Reorder segments via drag-and-drop
- Save queue state (persist across page refresh)

#### 3.2 Queue Status Indicators
- **Pending**: Not yet processed
- **Extracting**: FFmpeg extraction in progress
- **Uploading**: Sending to KlingAI API
- **Processing**: API processing
- **Complete**: Ready for review
- **Failed**: Error occurred (with reason)
- **Approved**: User approved replacement
- **Rejected**: User rejected, use original

### 4. Processing Pipeline

#### 4.1 Extraction Phase
- Extract video segment using FFmpeg
- Create separate audio file from segment
- Maintain original quality during extraction
- Store extracted files with unique identifiers
- Clean up extraction artifacts after processing

#### 4.2 API Integration

**KlingAI Lipsync API Documentation**: https://app.klingai.com/global/dev/document-api/apiReference/model/videoTolip

The developer should review the complete API documentation at the above URL for:
- Authentication methods and API key management
- Request/response formats
- File size and format limitations
- Rate limits and quotas
- Error codes and handling
- Best practices for optimal results

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Authenticate with KlingAI API using provided credentials
- Upload video and audio files according to API specifications
- Handle all API response codes appropriately
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Respect API rate limits and quotas
- Queue throttling if necessary to stay within limits
- Log all API interactions for debugging

#### 4.3 Progress Tracking

- Show current segment being processed
- Display overall queue progress
- Estimated time remaining
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 5. Review and Approval System

#### 5.1 Preview Interface
- Side-by-side comparison (original vs processed)
- Synchronized playback for comparison
- A/B toggle for quick comparison
- Quality metrics display (if available)
- Audio waveform comparison

#### 5.2 Approval Workflow
- **Approve**: Mark segment for replacement
- **Reject**: Keep original segment
- **Retry**: Reprocess with different settings (if applicable)
- Batch approval options
- Notes/comments per segment (optional)

### 6. Export System

#### 6.1 Export Process
- Compile final video based on approvals
- Splice original video at segment boundaries
- Insert processed segments at correct positions
- Maintain original video quality for untouched portions
- Preserve original audio for non-processed segments

#### 6.2 Export Options
- Output format selection
- Quality/bitrate settings
- Container format options
- Metadata preservation
- Optional watermark removal/addition

#### 6.3 Export Workflow
- Pre-export validation (all segments reviewed)
- Progress indication with time estimate
- Cancel capability
- Auto-download when complete
- Keep session alive until download confirmed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Process HD video (1080p) efficiently
- Support videos up to 2 hours in length
- Segment extraction under 5 seconds for 30-second clips
- Concurrent processing for multiple segments (where API allows)
- Memory usage optimization for large files

### Reliability
- Automatic session recovery after browser refresh
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Partial export capability (export with some segments unprocessed)
- Backup of original video throughout process
- Transaction-like processing (all or nothing for each segment)

### Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- Clear error messages with actionable solutions
- Responsive UI during processing
- Mobile-responsive design (tablet support minimum)
